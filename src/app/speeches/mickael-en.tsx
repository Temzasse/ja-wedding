      <h2>Mickaël</h2>
      <p>
        Julien, when you were born on Tuesday, June 10 1997, I was very far from
        my native Brittany. Well, I was at the end of my first year of my last
        school cycle, in the Grenoble region. I was very happy to be an uncle
        again, after having been one the first time with Marie, my goddaughter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like your sister Marie, I have very good memories of you, Julien, with
        your parents Valérie and Pierrick who educated you as fairly as
        possible, both with flexibility and firmness, but above all with respect
        and love.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember your short stays with your Breton grandparents in
        Montgermont. I remember our kicking games, with you and Marie, at the
        football field where we liked to go together, after crossing the fields
        of Rémi and Jean-Philippe. I also remember the times we spent with the
        little rabbits, « Smarties and Curieux » among others, with the
        chickens, with the little ducks and geese, with the little dog Elka and
        the high pony Oscar.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thank you for all the moments you spent with your grandparents at the
        hamlet Coupigné in Montgermont and the time you spent with your
        grandparents in Miramas. Your parents and your grandparents shaped you,
        year after year, to become all that you are today. As I am for your
        sister too, I am very pride of you Julien, of your life way, of the
        modern man you have become, of your beautiful escapes, here and there,
        across the world. I am amazed by that !
      </p>
      <p>
        The years have passed very quickly since Tuesday, June 10 1997, since I
        started working in August 2000 in the Paris region and since you
        finished your studies in the early two thousand twenties. I didn't see
        the time go by !
      </p>
      <p>
        I am very happy that you met Anne a few years ago already in Portugal.
      </p>
      <p>
        After attending the wedding of Anne of Brittany in 1491 (it's a long
        time ago, I want to clarify this), I am very happy to attend Anne of
        Finland's wedding and Julien of Brittany the Saturday, July 12 2025,
        with all your friends and family.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope to be a great uncle again very soon, after having been a great
        uncle twice, thanks to Marie and Maxime, with Lou-Zélie and Sidoine.
      </p>
      <p>Anne and Julien, I wish you a lot of happiness.</p>
