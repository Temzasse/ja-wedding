      <h2>Thérèse & Michel</h2>
      <p>Anne and Julien,</p>
      <p>
        This day is a great day for you, but as Grandparents, it is a great day
        for us too !
      </p>
      <p>
        What pride and what an honor to see our grandchildren building a home !
      </p>
      <p>
        How could we have hoped to attend the wedding of our grandson and so far
        ! What an expedition !
      </p>
      <p>
        We can only rejoice and be proud of you both, Anne and you, our little
        Juju !
      </p>
      <p>
        Julien, when he was a child, he was so shy, so timid: he was afraid of
        our customers, he was almost hiding under the table, but now, he could
        not go under the table !!! He has become very big !!!
      </p>
      <p>
        We thank you Julien for all the good times we have lived together and
        with your sister Marie at Coupigné near Rennes, as well as during our
        escapades and our holidays.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for your regular phone calls at the ends of the week. You
        don't forget us, that's very kind of you.
      </p>
      <p>
        We wish you a lot of happiness surrounded by your parents, Julien and
        your mother, Anne, parents who gave you a good education.
      </p>
      <p>
        Waiting and hoping for the coming of new great-grandchildren (but don't
        wait too long because we are on the downward slope !)
      </p>
      <p>
        All our best wishes for happiness with a good health for you and for all
        your family.
      </p>
      <p>We send you a big kiss !</p>
      <p>Grandpa and grandma who love you.</p>
