      <h2>Mathis</h2>
      <p>My dear friends.</p>
      <p>
        Imagine. Imagine a night in 2019, in a park. A Wednesday, February 4th.
        At Jardim do Morro, in Porto, Portugal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine a slightly tipsy Julien, struck above all by the arrival of his
        future Anne. Imagine Anne, bundled up in her big coat, orange hair. Yes,
        she was a redhead. Ready to dodge him, to escape her fate.
      </p>
      <p>
        And imagine if I had been there. The slightly drunk but determined
        friend. The one who mixes up the Macarena with the Madison at parties.
        The one who wouldn’t hesitate to walk up to that girl in the park,
        because my buddy would’ve whispered to me, “Mathis, it’s her.”
      </p>
      <p>
        So I would’ve gone. Without a second thought. Rosé in one hand, menthol
        cigarette in the other. Three little steps to the left, three to the
        right, towards that red-haired girl bundled up in her coat. And I
        would’ve said: “You see that stranger over there? He’s going to be the
        love of your life.”
      </p>
      <p>
        You probably would’ve smiled. A little surprised, but mostly skeptical:
        “Who is this drunk guy?” But I would’ve stayed calm. Certain.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I would’ve told you: That this stranger over there will give you his
        heart, will give you his words. That he will be your hand when life
        fails you, he’ll be your silence amidst the noise. That you will see
        everything of his life, everything of him, For better or worse, Through
        tears and laughter.
      </p>
      <p>
        That with Julien, the sky will always be clear. He will make you fly
        further— Beyond the grey skies, to where life is beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
        He will make you live a picture book life, in full color. He’ll become
        your wake, his arms a place where your fears can rest. He may have a
        short memory, but he’ll erase your doubts. He’ll build a trust in stone,
        that stands the test of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would have added: That behind his quietness lies a huge heart. That
        his loyalty hides endless patience. That he will love you simply,
        wholly, without hesitation. That he’ll be the beginning of your forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        He will love you quietly, with a rare kind of devotion. He will make you
        laugh with questionable jokes— but ones you’ll grow to love. He’ll offer
        you tenderness without pretense, a shelter you find when you least
        expect it.
      </p>
      <p>
        He will be the missing note, to complete your harmony. Guided in
        Finland, far beyond the northern lights.
      </p>
      <p>
        And here we are, six years later. Surrounded by those who love you. And
        I’m here, standing before you with absolute certainty: you are for each
        other what fate does best — a meeting that didn’t miss its moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anne, you entered his life like something obvious, and now, you are part
        of ours.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I wish you a life just like that encounter: simple, strong, a little
        awkward, discreet yet overwhelming. The sparkle of the present, the
        eternal that lasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        A life of true love, of honest laughter, of shared silences. A life
        together—never without each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        So you see that stranger over there? It’s him. He’s the love of your
        life.
