      <h2>üó£Ô∏è Teemu</h2>
      <p>My name is Teemu and I‚Äôm one of Julien‚Äôs bestmen.</p>
      <p>
        I would like to start by congratulating the beautiful couple one more
        time. I‚Äôm truly honoured to be part of this magical day and to share
        this special moment with two of my favourite people: Julien and Anne.
      </p>
      <p>
        I‚Äôve known Julien and Anne for over three years. It all started when I
        met Julien at work interviewing him for a position at our software
        consultancy firm called Taito United. I still remember vividly how
        meeting Julien felt like meeting your best friend. It was like we had
        known each other forever even though we just met. We hit it off
        immediately and after the interview I remember telling my boss: ‚ÄúYou
        gotta hire this guy!‚Äù. And not long after we became colleagues and have
        been ever since. For a while I had the privilege of mentoring Julien,
        but he quickly leveled up to mentor other people at Taito. We‚Äôve had
        incredible experiences working, and partying, together at work but the
        highlight of our developer journey came last year when we managed to win
        second place in one of Europe‚Äôs biggest coding hackathons. That was a
        very special moment that I will remember for a long time.

      <p>
        From seeing each other at work we quickly started seeing each other
        outside of work as well, mainly in the form of doing sports and other
        fun activities. This might come as a surprise to many of you but Julien
        is quite competitive. I could even say he is perhaps the most
        competitive person I know. This is probably one of the reasons why we
        get along so well as I‚Äôm known to be quite competitive myself. There
        have been many battles between the two of us in various sports such as
        basketball, padel, tennis, and axe throwing, and I would like to say
        that I have won most of them, but that would be bending the truth a bit
        too much. Despite my busted knee I‚Äôve given Julien a proper challenge,
        and will keep doing so as long as I can.
      </p>
      <p>
        It‚Äôs truly a miracle that Julien has managed to find such a beautiful
        bride who is not only funny, compassionate and loving, but is also
        willing to overlook his crooked nose. Julien even moved to another
        country and started a new life here which takes great bravery. Not to
        mention adapting to a new culture and learning a new language,
        especially a language like Finnish, can be very tough. However, as we
        all know, Julien is not afraid of such challenges. In fact, Julien‚Äôs
        Finnish is coming along quite great - he‚Äôs already nailed the part where
        you don‚Äôt say anything. So I would say he‚Äôs on his way to be a proper
        introvert like a true Finn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let‚Äôs talk about Julien‚Äôs character. I‚Äôve been fortunate to have
        many friends in life, but very few I admire and trust as much as I do
        Julien. There have been countless times he‚Äôs been there when I needed
        help. Like not too long ago he helped me dig a massive hole in my yard
        for a new patio - without blackmail, I might add. And last year Julien
        picked me up from the hospital after my knee surgery, but was greatly
        disappointed that I wasn‚Äôt high enough on meds to blabber embarrassing
        things to him. Yet the thing I appreciate the most is the way Julien
        supported me when my dad died. I‚Äôll never forget that Juhannus when
        Julien and Anne were at our summer cottage in Puumala and Julien helped
        me finish building the outhouse that my father had designed and started
        building just before he passed away. Thank you for that.
      </p>

        However, no friendship is perfect and even our bromance has had its ups
        and downs: first Julien was mortified that I didn‚Äôt wash my feet with
        soap in the shower and later he challenged my views on orange juice
        quality in Finland. Recently I have questioned Julien as a friend and a
        human being when I learned that he likes to sit on the first row in the
        movie theatre - like what kind of maniac does that?!? And one time
        Julien almost called the police when I brought horse meat to a raclette
        dinner - apparently that is the highest level of disrespect in France.
        However, all strong relationships are fortified by conquering hardship.
        The same applies to marriage. In between all the joyful moments, there
        will be challenges. That‚Äôs the truth in any real relationship. But those
        moments give you the chance to choose each other‚Äînot just once, but
        every day, through the good, the ordinary, and the absurd. There‚Äôs an
        old saying that successful marriage requires falling in love many times,
        always with the same person. And that‚Äôs what love really is: not a
        one-time decision, but a daily act of choosing to love each other. With
        intention, with effort, and‚Äîsometimes‚Äîwith a glass of wine and a deep
        breath. That is the deepest gesture of love one can make, as in the end,
        love is always a choice. So tonight, let‚Äôs raise our glasses to Julien
        and Anne‚Äîmay you always choose to love each other, even when life throws
        bland orange juice, bad weather, or horse meat at you.
      </p>
      <p>To love!</p>
