      <h2>Hilda</h2>
      <p>Dear wedding guests and the lovely couple</p>
      <p>
        It is a great honor to stand here today as the maid of honor—not only
        because this day is special, but because I get to celebrate it alongside
        one of the most important people in my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anne has been my friend, travel companion, trusted listener, and at
        times even the navigator of my life—despite the fact that she herself
        has occasionally gotten lost in different corners of the world. It’s
        been admirable to witness how you’ve journeyed through life with an open
        mind, your heart as your map and your passport as an extension of your
        hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anne and I met during high school and ended up in the same class after
        we both chose to take Spanish. Funny to think that back then, no one
        would’ve guessed she’d one day marry a Spanish-speaking Frenchman—and
        that it would all begin in Porto.
      </p>
      <p>
        But that’s what love does—it surprises you, carries you along, and
        eventually brings the right person into your life, even from across the
        continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also met Julien for the first time in Porto, when I traveled there to
        visit Anne. At the time, Anne didn’t exactly admit out loud that she was
        head over heels for Julien—but she didn’t need to. Everyone could see
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Julien, you brought with you French charm, but more than that: a
        calmness, warmth, and gentleness. There is something genuine and steady
        between you and Anne—something that doesn’t happen by chance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your shared passion for travel says a lot about the kind of couple you
        are: curious, brave, always ready for new experiences—but always
        together. No matter where in the world you are, you have a home in each
        other.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I’d like to raise a toast: To our friendship, To the love that was
        found in Porto, And to the journey ahead, which will take you to many
        more places—together.
      </p>
      <p>Cheers!</p>
