      <h2>Marie</h2>
      <p>My Juju, my little brother</p>
      <p>
        You came into our lives when I was three years old, and let’s just say
        you made quite the entrance. You cried a lot as a baby, then pretended
        not to hear us as you grew up—but none of that stopped me from
        developing a deep love for you and an unstoppable need to protect you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember playing referee whenever I could during your marble duels,
        making up as many rules as needed until you won the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure, you fully embraced the role of little brother with a few
        stuffed-animal hits and some judo moves, but more than anything, you
        were my partner in play and laughter!
      </p>
      <p>
        I can still see us pretending to be snails under the blankets at Grandpa
        and Grandma’s house, playing with animals, and setting up imaginary wine
        shops during our vacations in Montremont.
      </p>
      <p>
        How could I forget our summers in Miramas with the cousins? Whole
        afternoons spent in the pool, outings to the fair, makeup sessions where
        I turned you into the perfect cousin, and your “just like Dad” shows to
        entertain us on sweltering afternoons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, my playmate grew distant, but I’m so proud to see you exploring the
        world and having the courage I never had! You have this ease about
        trying new things without fear. I would have never been able to go
        skydiving if I hadn’t had you calmly by my side to take the leap!
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ll never forget the day you chose to stay with me when I was sick
        instead of going to a party, or the time you postponed your flight in
        hopes of meeting your niece before heading back to Anne.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope Lou-Zélie and Sidoine share the same bond and relationship we’ve
        had, and to my great joy, I believe they’re off to a great start.
      </p>
      <p>
        To my little brother who has grown up, I want to say thank you for being
        the wonderful man and uncle you are, and for bringing us all together
        today to celebrate this new chapter with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anne, I also want to say a few words to you: thank you for taking such
        good care of my brother. I warmly welcome you into our family today—as a
        sister.
      </p>
      <p>
        And as the song says, “I wish you all the happiness in the world, that
        your path avoids bombs and leads to peaceful gardens.”
      </p>
      <p>I love you.</p>
