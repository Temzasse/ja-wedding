      <p>Dear Anne and Julien</p>
      <p>Congratulations, bridal couple.</p>
      <p>
        I am filled with joy for you on this day of love and happiness—your
        wedding day. Even Finnish summer and nature are smiling with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the moment Anne was born, I’ve been part of her life. I’m her
        godmother and a close friend of her mother.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ve shared baptisms, confirmations, graduations, birthdays—and
        countless moments of everyday life in between.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, Anne has grown into a determined and courageous woman,
        and I’ve watched it all with pride.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her decision to become an exchange student in Mexico especially
        delighted me. It showed her boldness and open-mindedness.
      </p>
      <p>
        We had the joy of visiting Anne’s host family in Mexico—Mama Irene and
        Papa Sergio. Though we didn’t share a common language, we got along
        wonderfully. This family became very dear to Anne. Sadly, they couldn’t
        attend today’s wedding celebration. In countries like Mexico, things
        aren’t always as straightforward as they may be here in Finland—travel
        conditions and starting points can be vastly different.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then came her Erasmus exchange in Porto, Portugal in 2019, which turned
        out to be a fateful journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was thrilled by her choice—new language, culture, and experiences
        ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
        But why “fateful”? Because Julien was also in Porto. That’s where their
        paths crossed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Julien followed Anne to Finland after Porto. We first met him in their
        cozy rental apartment in Vantaa. That phase was brief, as both received
        internships in Barcelona.
      </p>
      <p>
        When COVID hit, their six months in Barcelona were mostly spent between
        four walls—which must have offered a pretty solid crash course in
        getting to know each other!
      </p>
      <p>
        Julien impressed us right away—charming and easygoing, much like Anne.
        His social nature made it easy to connect with us, the older generation,
        too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Julien has proven to be quite the “Finnish-in-spirit” son-in-law. He
        absolutely loves sauna and cabin life. On shared cabin trips, he’s
        always the last one out of the sauna and the first one into the icy
        lake.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last Easter, the couple’s unofficial engagement photo was taken during
        one such cabin weekend—and we’ve been looking forward to this wedding
        ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
        Esa and I wish you both all the happiness in the world as you begin this
        life together. With trust and love, we send you off on your shared
        journey.
      </p>
      <p>P.S. The bride is stunning and the groom is dashing.</p>
      <p>Cheers, santé, salud, kippis!</p>
