      <h2>Adil</h2>
      <p>
        Julien and Anne are probably a bit nervous that I’ll say something
        embarrassing… but don’t worry, I’ll try to behave. Promise. Try.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who don’t know me, I’m Adil — Julien’s “exotic” friend. The
        one that lets him say: “I’m not racist, my best man is from Morocco.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Today I wanted to take you on a quick trip back in time thanks to my
        time machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>March 2016.</strong> Julien posted on a Facebook asking which
        classes to pick for his year abroad in Chile — as if he actually planned
        to study with nine hours of class per week. I replied instantly. I knew,
        even then, that he’d need me for life. And I was right.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>April 2016.</strong> We meet at a party in Lille. Among all the
        friendly faces, one stood out: a wild, laughing Breton who loved silly
        jokes and dreamed of unforgettable adventures as much as I did or even
        more. That was the start of something special. We partied, traveled
        across Chile, Bolivia, Peru. Learned Spanish. Built memories for life.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>April 2017.</strong> Julien gets on one knee and pops the most
        important question of his life — well, until now. “Adil, my love, BRO…
        will you be my roommate?” It was awkward. He kind of begged. As I’m very
        generous I accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2017-2018: The Golden Age.</strong> Living with Julien meant:
        endless laughter, carbonara rice to cure hangovers, late-night guitar
        sessions, deep talks about everything… except football cause he doesn’t
        know anything about it PLAYING Fifa where I would absolutely smash him
        Julien sharing everything. Even the 34 cents for salt. Yes — he split
        that.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Christmas 2018:</strong> Our brotherhood grew even stronger. I
        had nowhere to go, and Julien invited me join his family. It was my
        first real Christmas. I had no money back then, I asked Julien if I
        should bring gifts, and he said no. So I came empty-handed—and everyone
        had something for me. I understood 2 things : Never trust Julien. And I
        also understood where Julien got his kindness and why I always felt that
        he was like a brother to me. They welcomed like a king and I’ve never
        drunk so much alcohol in my life. I also understood why Julien was a bit
        slow when I learnt that the had his first glass of rhum when he was not
        even 3. Since then, I’ve spent 5 Christmases with the Texiers. BUT
        EVERYTHING CHANGED in 2019.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2019:</strong> Julien moves to Portugal… and meets someone. From
        the way he talked about her, I knew it was serious. He was fascinated
        and under a spell.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2021:</strong> The first time I met Anne was in Paris. She
        smiled at me like Julien had warned her I was trouble. I looked at her
        but most importantly I looked at Julien’s eyes cause they never lie and
        that I can read you like an open book— and they were shining. Full of
        love, fascination and passion.I instantly saw why he was crazy about
        you. Anne, you’re smart, kind, strong . And you laugh at my jokes — so
        obviously, you’re perfect. I teased you and still do a lot, but it only
        means that you’re family to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m glad that we built our own little tradition. You both stayed at my
        place, we shared meals, drinks, holidays and we were like a small
        family, you even made me watch High School Musical. When I saw you two
        taking care of Loulou and Sidoine I knew that you were made to be the
        best parents ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I wasn’t surprised when Julien called last year and said, “ don’t be
        jealous but I proposed.” Just like I wasn’t surprised when you told me
        yesterday that after our time together, you lived with many people and
        it wasn’t the same, everything felt empty and you miss me everyday.
        Anyways, could talk for hours, but Julien told me no more than 5 min
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me finish with two things to show you that I can speak many
        languages:{" "}
        <strong>Anne, olet kuin sisko minulle ja rakastan sinua.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Julien, mon frère, je te souhaite que du bonheur dans cette belle
        aventure de vie, je te remercierai jamais assez pour tout ce que tu as
        fait pour moi. On se le dit pas assez parce qu’on fait genre on est des
        bonhommes, mais aujourd’hui on est des hommes donc je te dis un gros je
        t’aime. That meant thanks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m not supposed to tell you , but I used the Time Machine again — and I
        saw your future. It’s bright. Full of joy, discovery, adventures .one
        Adil… and maybe one little Adila Jr. But above all, it’s filled with
        love and respect — between you two, and from everyone here.
      </p>
      <p>
        So let’s raise our glasses to Julien and Anne — to their past, present,
        and beautiful future.
      </p>
      <p>Your forever third wheel.</p>
