      <h2>Moona</h2>
      <p>
        Hi Everyone, I'm Moona, friend of Anne and proudly one of her maids of
        honour today. I am so excited to celebrate this beautiful couple with
        all of you.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I met Anne on our confirmation summer at 15years old we became
        friends instantly, and felt like we have known each other for a long
        time. Already at this time Anne had a special character of being loud
        and silly, but also soft and creative in her thoughts. We shared a
        desire of travelling the world and finding connections from all over,
        and I guess somewhow boosted each others to be brave and just go without
        fear. She became my ride-or-die partner and she would always have the
        right words and warmest hugs when needed - she felt like home to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        We ended up in the same highschool and from there our friendship only
        kept growing stronger. At these times I always felt like home at Anne
        and her moms house, and I would spend days just eat and cuddle our tiny
        worries away. Anne became part of my family too, even my 95-years old
        Granddad took her as one of his own, and would be disappointed if ever I
        would visit him without Anne.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then one day Anne called me explaining that she had found old pictures
        from her laptop, and was pretty sure I am in them with her. These
        pictures were taken on a summer camp when we were 8-years old, and I
        guess you can already see that we were ment to find each other again. We
        had just lost each other for a while before life brought us back
        together.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now, over 20 years later, I get to stand by her side again, this
        time to witness her endless love towards people - in this case
        especially to Julien.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the friendship story of me and Anne proves; it is all about the small
        coinsidences in life that becomes most important things. Suddenly a new
        person is part of your life and you could not imagine it without them.
      </p>
      <p>
        So - because of one special coinsidence 6 years ago in Portugal - we are
        all here today, celebrating love. We are becoming part of each others
        stories and memories, built up from all the turns we took in our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Julien, Juju, Julkku as we say, you have brought so much joy and
        happiness to Annes life, and together with her you have created a home
        that feels just like the ones we grew up in - so safe and special.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anne, you have brought even more laughter, understunding and sisterhood
        in mine. You are the most caring, calming and compassionate friend one
        could ask for, and I can't thank you enough for standing by my side for
        all of these years and phases in life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am excited to see what the future hold for you two, and what kind of
        coinsidences will shape on your path.
      </p>
      <p>
        So now, I would like to raise a toast for the love of Anne and Julien,
        and to all the coinsidences that let you two meet each other. I love you
        both so much and I wish endless love, laughter and adventures on your
        story.
      </p>
      <p>Cheers!</p>
