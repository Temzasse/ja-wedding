      <h2>Pierrick & Valérie</h2>
      <p>Dear Julien, dear Anne</p>
      <p data-color-one>
        We are so happy to be here with you, in Finland, to celebrate your
        beautiful union. We are delighted to reconnect with your families, and
        to meet or reunite with your friends—many of whom we’ve heard so much
        about. We do not forget those who are absent, those who couldn’t make
        it, and of course, those who left us too soon and are watching over us
        from above.
      </p>
      <p data-color-two>
        Anne, we feel it’s important to tell you a bit more about your husband.
        To get to this point, our dear Julien had to go through many stages that
        shaped his character and made him the open-minded, cheerful, sparkling,
        and people-loving man he is today. Let’s start with his early days… He
        wasn’t in a hurry to arrive, that little guy!
      </p>
      <p data-color-one>
        He was born several days past his due date, with a round little face and
        skin as white as snow. His cousins nicknamed him CASPER (the little
        ghost). The first few months weren’t exactly restful—at least, that’s
        what your mom reminds us: a light sleeper, a big crier. Today, it seems
        he’s more of a heavy sleeper and less of a crier—at least we hope so…
      </p>
      <p data-color-two>
        He’s always been very close with his sister Marie, even though she often
        used her big sister status to pass her chores onto him. But she’s always
        been there to support him and share the good times.
      </p>
      <p data-color-two>
        As a child, Julien was shy, a bit rebellious… When he was on vacation at
        Grandpa Michel and Grandma Thérèse’s, and customers came to pick up
        their wine orders (yes, he was around wine early on), Julien would hide
        under the table to avoid saying hello…
      </p>
      <p data-color-one>
        Thankfully, those days are long gone. Now, he’s not afraid to approach
        others—quite the opposite. He breaks down barriers, overcomes obstacles
        to connect with people, always with kindness, always aiming to make
        others feel comfortable and to share unique moments. We are so proud of
        the man he has become.
      </p>
      <p data-color-two>
        His childhood was also filled with vacations at his grandparents’ homes.
        Whether it was being around “not-so-wild” animals (dogs, rabbits,
        chickens, geese, ponies…), building forts and digging holes (right,
        Grandpa Michel?), or exploring different regions with his Breton
        grandparents, joking with Uncle Mickaël… And every summer, he loved
        visiting Grandpa Riquet and Grandma Monique in the South to enjoy the
        sunshine, share fun times in the pool, play wild card games, get into
        ping-pong, and have fun with his cousins (poor guy, he was the only boy
        and they gave him a bit of a hard time… Right, Pauline, Mégane, and
        Marie?) It was at Aunt Sophie’s, in the shade of the trees and with the
        sound of cicadas, that he first learned to play pétanque. We know how
        much those moments meant to him. Despite the distance, he still calls
        everyone every week, and it touches their hearts deeply.
      </p>
      <p data-color-one>
        We won’t go into every detail of his youth, but it’s worth noting that
        Julien always had plans and ideas—so much so that we nicknamed him ARCHI
        (short for architect…).
      </p>
      <p data-color-one>
        In sports, he started with judo, then football, and eventually
        basketball with Médéric and Alexis (who are here today), with Flora as
        his number one supporter (still cheering him on today). He also played
        guitar. He formed a band, SHADOWS OF TIME (another member, Wistan, is
        here today), and they were selected to perform at the Woodstock of
        Vern-sur-Seiche, where we live, at the Feu au Lac festival. He even
        tried his hand at being a DJ.
      </p>
      <p data-color-two>
        Academically, he never had trouble adapting. He didn’t cling to his
        usual friends but always looked to expand his circle—even turning
        enemies into friends, right Mathis? He pursued brilliant studies and was
        always there to help others who were struggling. That kindness of his
        was always present. He moved from one class to the next without ever
        aiming to be the best, even though he could have been. Determined, he
        wanted to take his courses in English from his first year of higher
        education, so he went alone to Ireland for two months, staying with
        someone he had only contacted online. At IESEG in Lille, he made
        wonderful connections and lasting friendships—some of whom are here
        today: Adil, Véronique, and Neama.
      </p>
      <p data-color-one>
        Later on, he never stopped wanting to travel, even though his very first
        solo flight to Marseille at the age of four required the intervention of
        firefighters to calm his anxiety. That’s how we were able to visit him:
        in CHILE, where we all have unforgettable memories (right, Adil?), in
        PORTO, where we first started hearing the sweet name of Anne... And then
        we had the joy of meeting you, dear Anne. You integrated into our family
        so naturally, thanks to your kindness and your warm personality.
      </p>
      <p data-color-one>
        During your stay in Barcelona, in the midst of COVID, you were confined.
        That probably served as a crash test to validate your mutual feelings.
      </p>
      <p data-color-one>
        Your experiences and the way you connect with others have undoubtedly
        brought you closer, and it’s with immense joy that we’ve watched your
        relationship grow into the beautiful day we’re celebrating now.
      </p>
      <p data-color-two>
        Julien is an inspiration, an ideal son, an extraordinary friend, and
        someone we always want to have close. And you too, dear Anne, have built
        sincere friendships around you, and we’re sure your loved ones are just
        as proud of you as we are.
      </p>
      <p data-color-two>
        We’re happy to see you both thriving, even far from home. We’re so glad
        to have you as our daughter-in-law, and we wish you both a beautiful
        future together, all the happiness in the world—and we can’t wait for
        your little family to grow, with babies just like you. You’ve already
        had some practice with Lou-Zélie and Sidoine, of whom Julien is the
        godfather.
      </p>
      <p data-color-one>
        On this July 12th, France now has two major events to celebrate: Your
        wedding in 2025, and the first World Cup victory in 1998 (it&#39;s been
        exactly 27 years today!) when France beat Brazil!
      </p>
      <p>So, long live the newlyweds — we love you!</p>
